          <h2 class="spacer-medium">Are you interested in mentoring a new community member at RubyConf 2015? We're looking for volunteer Guides to partner up with this year's Opportunity Scholars.</h2>
          <p>Scholars are folks who are new to the Ruby community or language, or maybe even new to writing code altogether. Something about Ruby and our community really speaks to them though, and they're ready to have their first -- hopefully transformative -- RubyConf experience. They've told us the amazing stories of their path to RubyConf, and we think they're going to be wonderful additions to our community. Your job is to help us welcome and shepherd them in appropriately!</p>
          <p class="spacer-medium">While there is certainly an intangible component of what makes a great Guide, there are also a few things that we're looking for specifically:</p>
          <ul class="spacer-medium rc-red">
            <li>Guides should be comfortable being available as a friendly face for their Scholars throughout the whole conference. You don’t have to stick with them like glue the whole time, but you should at least be able to meet with them a few times a day.</li>
            <li>Guides should be able to recommend great talks for Scholars to attend after hearing about their interests, current skill levels, and experiences.</li>
            <li>Guides should be comfortable making introductions between Scholars and established developers, especially ones that might be particularly influential in the Scholars' areas of interest.</li>
            <li>Guides should be able to give some feedback on breaking into the Ruby work world, especially for Scholars looking for their first Ruby gig!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some examples of folks who have made fantastic Guides in the past are: RubyConf speakers, folks who are at their ​second​ RubyConf (meaning they remember what it's like to be new!), Hallway Track Superstars, and former RubyConf or RailsConf Opportunity Scholars... but even if you don't fit in one of those categories, you may still be a great Guide fit -- apply using the link on the right and tell us why you'd be a great community ambassador!</p>

          <h3 class="rc-red">Opportunity Scholarships​</h3>
          <h2 class="spacer-medium">RubyConf 2015 is offering a limited number of full conference registration scholarships, open to anyone who would not normally attend, though we specifically encourage students, women, minorities, and other under-represented groups in the technology sector to apply. The Opportunity Scholarship is a chance to jump in to learn more about the Ruby programming language specifically and software development in general.</h2>
          <p>Scholars will be partnered with Guides (see above for more info on them!): experienced programmers who have attended RubyConf before and are already familiar with many of the key players at the conference. You do not have to be a “rock star” developer to apply. We are looking for anyone who is comfortable welcoming a newbie to our awesome community.</p>
          <p>If you or someone you know is interested in applying, we'll be accepting applications from August 24 - September 14. Visit this page again during that time period for a link to apply.</p>
