          <p class="spacer-medium">Large scale and fast production Ruby applications are not a myth. As we’ve continued to scale out our infrastructure and our application, we’ve been able to keep things fast and reliable. We do this by building and using tools that take advantage the great improvements that have come in Ruby 2. I’d like to share some of the lessons we’ve learned in scaling our app as well as show off the latest and greatest in open source performance tooling.</p>

          <p class="spacer-small">In Ruby, assignment is our primary tool. By contrast, functional programming makes much less use of assignment and mutation. Instead techniques like function composition, recursion, and anonymous functions are used.</p>
          <p class="spacer-medium">Despite being OO, Ruby accommodates pure functional approaches. This talk will demonstrate how tasks can be accomplished without assignment. Ruby and Scheme will be used for examples. I’ll also discuss some of the great resources available for those interested in digging deeper into functional programming.</p>
